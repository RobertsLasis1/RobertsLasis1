# 👋 Hey, I'm Roberts Lasis

I'm a software developer who enjoys solving problems and keeping things simple where possible.  
Most of my work revolves around **.NET**, **C#**, **TypeScript**, **SQL** and **Spark**, but I’ve touched plenty of other tools over the years - whatever helps get things done right.

I like systems that are easy to reason about and that don’t fall apart under pressure.  
Clean code, clear structure, and a bit of curiosity go a long way.
